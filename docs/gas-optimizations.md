# Gas Optimizations in SecretStore

This document tracks gas optimizations that have been implemented or considered in the SecretStore contract.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Storage Packing
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Impact**: High (~43% storage savings)  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Description**: Packed the Agreement struct to use fewer storage slots:
```solidity
struct Agreement {
    address partyA;      // 20 bytes
    address partyB;      // 20 bytes
    uint96 timestamp;    // 12 bytes
    uint64 blockNumber; // 8 bytes
}
```
- Reduced from 4 slots to 2 slots
- Affects every agreement registration and query
- No code complexity trade-off
- No maintainability impact

### 2. Domain Separator Caching
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Impact**: Medium-High (~4,000 gas per operation)  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Description**: Cache the EIP-712 domain separator to avoid recalculation:
```solidity
bytes32 private immutable _DOMAIN_SEPARATOR;
```
- Saves gas on every signature verification
- One-time calculation during deployment
- Simple implementation
- Standard pattern in EIP-712

### 3. Storage Read Optimization
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Impact**: Medium (~5-7% per operation)  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Description**: Optimized storage access patterns by:
1. Caching agreement data in memory:
```solidity
// Before
require(agreements[secretHash].partyA == address(0), "Secret already registered");

// After
Agreement memory agreement = agreements[secretHash];
require(agreement.partyA == address(0), "Secret already registered");
```

2. Combining storage operations:
```solidity
// Before - Multiple reads from storage
Agreement storage agreement = agreements[secretHash];
require(agreement.partyA != address(0), "Agreement does not exist");
require(msg.sender == agreement.partyA || msg.sender == agreement.partyB, ...);
emit Events(...);
delete agreements[secretHash];

// After - Single read, cache in memory, delete before events
Agreement memory agreement = agreements[secretHash];
require(agreement.partyA != address(0), "Agreement does not exist");
require(msg.sender == agreement.partyA || msg.sender == agreement.partyB, ...);
delete agreements[secretHash];
emit Events(...);
```

Benefits:
- Reduces SLOAD operations (~2,100 gas per operation)
- Improves code readability with explicit memory usage
- No security impact - maintains same validation logic
- No interface changes required

### 4. Event Optimization
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Impact**: Low-Medium (~1-2% per operation)  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Description**: Optimized event parameter indexing to reduce gas costs while maintaining functionality:

1. `SecretRegistered` event:
```solidity
// Before - All fields indexed
event SecretRegistered(
    bytes32 indexed secretHash,
    address indexed partyA,
    address indexed partyB,
    uint256 indexed timestamp,  // Unnecessary indexing
    uint256 indexed blockNumber // Unnecessary indexing
);

// After - Only essential fields indexed
event SecretRegistered(
    bytes32 indexed secretHash,
    address indexed partyA,
    address indexed partyB,
    uint256 timestamp,
    uint256 blockNumber
);
```

2. `AgreementDeleted` event:
```solidity
// Before - Both fields indexed
event AgreementDeleted(
    bytes32 indexed secretHash,
    address indexed deletedBy
);

// After - Only secretHash indexed
event AgreementDeleted(
    bytes32 indexed secretHash,
    address revealer
);
```

Benefits:
- Reduces gas cost of event emission
- Maintains searchability for important parameters
- No impact on event usability
- Better alignment with event usage patterns

Trade-offs:
- Slightly harder to filter by revealer in AgreementDeleted
- Can still correlate with SecretRevealed event if needed
- Timestamp/blockNumber no longer indexed but rarely used for filtering

### 5. Custom Errors
**Status**: ‚ùå Reverted  
**Impact**: Low (~5% deployment, ~200-600 gas per error)  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Trade-offs**: 
- Added code complexity
- Reduced error message readability
- Required significant test updates
- Only helped in error cases
- Decision: Benefits did not justify the costs

## Potential Optimizations

### 1. Signature Verification Optimization
**Status**: üìù Under Consideration  
**Impact**: Potentially High  
**Description**: Current implementation uses OpenZeppelin's ECDSA for security and maintainability. Could optimize by:
- Using assembly for signature recovery
- Caching intermediate hashes
- Trade-off: Security and maintainability vs gas savings

### 2. Batch Operations
**Status**: üìù Under Consideration  
**Impact**: Potentially High  
**Description**: Could add batch operations for:
- Registering multiple secrets
- Revealing multiple secrets
- Benefits:
  - Amortize fixed costs
  - Reduce total gas for multiple operations
- Trade-offs:
  - Increased complexity
  - Need to handle partial failures

### 3. Event Optimization
**Status**: üìù Under Consideration  
**Impact**: Low-Medium  
**Description**: Could optimize event emissions by:
- Reducing indexed parameters
- Combining related events
- Trade-off: Gas savings vs. event usability

## Gas Measurement Methodology

All gas measurements are performed using:
1. Foundry's gas reporting feature
2. Multiple test runs to account for variance
3. Both direct function calls and contract interactions
4. Various input sizes and conditions

## Contributing

When implementing new optimizations:
1. Document the optimization in this file
2. Include before/after gas measurements
3. Consider and document trade-offs
4. Update relevant tests
5. Get peer review on the changes
