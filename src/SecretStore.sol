/// @title SecretStore
/// @notice A contract for securely storing and revealing secrets between two parties
/// @dev Uses EIP-712 for typed signatures with robust replay protection:
///      - Domain separator includes contract name, version, chain ID, and address
///      - Signatures are bound to specific parties and cannot be reused
///      - Agreements are deleted after reveal to prevent reuse
///      - Uses OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library for secure signature verification
/// @custom:security Important security notes:
///      1. Agreement existence is checked using partyA address. A zero address for
///         partyA indicates no agreement exists.
///      2. The contract is upgradeable using UUPS pattern:
///         - Only UPGRADER_ROLE can perform upgrades
///         - State is preserved across upgrades via proxy storage
///         - Initialization can only happen once on the proxy
///         - New implementations must maintain storage layout compatibility
